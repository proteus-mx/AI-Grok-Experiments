# AI-Grok-Experiments

This project contains a series of tinkerings eith xAI's Grok. 

Using some sinple Prompt Engineering techniques and over a series of iterations, I've captured some of the outputs achieved ranging from simple 2D mazes and games to more complex 3D games playing autonomously.

Outputs viewable here:

recordings captured here: https://x.com/proteusmx?s=21

Approach:
1. Ideate 
2. NL initial promot into Grok (mainly using grok3 model, occasionally grok2)
3. Preview generated code (HTML & JavaScript)
4. increase conplexity and tailor through durther prompts.
5. Iterate until sufficient output generated
 
note, occasionally grok introduces JavaScript errors, which are typically corrected with a prompt to fix.
