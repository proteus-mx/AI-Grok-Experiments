    <p>
      SaiMON does not collect or store personal data. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information may be accessed or shared through use of the app.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Game Center</h2>
    <p>
      Our app uses Apple’s Game Center to provide leaderboards and achievements. Game Center is a service provided by Apple, and your participation is subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy. We do not store or access your Game Center credentials. Any data (such as scores) submitted is handled by Apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information, please see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
    <p>
      Our app displays game content hosted on an external website. While the app itself does not collect any personal information, the website may use cookies or analytics tools to improve the experience. Please review the website's privacy practices separately if applicable.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      The app does not collect, store, or share personal information. Game progress (such as scores) is shared with Game Center for leaderboard functionality. No other data is transmitted or stored.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Sharing Features</h2>
    <p>
      The app includes a sharing option that allows users to share a game link and message via their device's built-in share sheet. This function does not collect any personal data.
